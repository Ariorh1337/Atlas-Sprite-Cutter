#ABOUT#
This script is designed to automatically slice the atlas from the TexturePackerGUI program.
In the `input` folder you need to put the `PNG` and `JSON` atlas files.
At start, you will need to specify the name of the atlas as a parameter.
As a result, you will receive individual PNG files in the output folder.

#INSTALL#
